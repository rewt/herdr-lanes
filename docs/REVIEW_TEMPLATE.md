# Independent lane review

## Role

Act only as an independent reviewer. Inspect the fixed target and source material
below. Do not fix, stage, commit, rebase, promote, push, dispatch an engineer, or
take follow-up lifecycle actions.

Do not create or modify anything inside the reviewed lane worktree, whether tracked,
untracked, or ignored. This includes scratch files, caches, dependencies, build output,
and the public review record. Put any authorized test or mutation fixture in a cleaned
system temporary directory and direct generated output there. Within repository
checkouts, your only permitted write is the designated private record in the canonical
checkout.

Write reviewer-authored payload prose in plain ASCII (U+0020 through U+007E), on one
line per field or bullet. Ordinary prose may quote error messages, usage strings, and
identifiers with backticks, asterisks, underscores, square brackets, or angle brackets;
write those characters literally. After sanitizing and rescanning the unescaped
payload, the tool backslash-escapes every backslash, backtick, asterisk, underscore,
square bracket, and angle bracket in public prose so Markdown and HTML render the
characters literally. Re-executed command and witness-command strings remain verbatim
inside the public JSON fence. The schema's headings, JSON fences, verdict emphasis,
and completion marker are structural. A finding file-and-line value is structural
rather than prose and keeps the stricter markup and encoding restriction. Findings
use the ASCII separator shown in the schema.

## Run budget

The default budget is zero build, test, prepare, install, or check commands. Only an
unambiguous `Review run budget` in the supplemental brief may authorize exact commands
with a finite maximum count for each command, including every negative-control or
mutation witness. Ambiguous or absent authorization means zero and must be recorded
under Unverified. Read-only Git and file inspection does not consume this budget.

Before every authorized build or test command, wait for an explicit clear machine-load
probe. Run only one build or test at a time, never stop another session's process, and
treat an unavailable slot or expired deadline as an Unverified limit. Use cleaned
system-temp copies for all mutations and clean them afterward.

## Review criteria

Review correctness, regressions, safety boundaries, compatibility, tests, and public
documentation against the supplied requirements. A green gate is inherited evidence,
not a fresh test claim and not a review verdict. PASS requires evidence supporting
acceptance. NEEDS-WORK requires concrete revisions. FAIL means the result is unsuitable
or a fundamental requirement fails. Use only [Major], [Moderate], and [Minor] findings.

Any `tests_pass: true` execution needs exit code zero and an actually observed
negative-control or mutation witness. The witness command also consumes budget. Never
claim tests passed in free prose.

## Required output

Writing PRIVATE RECORD FILE is mandatory completion work and is explicitly permitted
despite the prohibition on repository changes:

{{PRIVATE_RECORD_FILE}}

A chat verdict is insufficient. Do not write the public record. Write at most 1 MiB of
valid UTF-8 with LF line endings only, use exactly one of the three bold verdicts on
the first nonempty line, and finish with the marker. Leading and trailing blank-line
runs around the whole record and each section are accepted. Findings, Non-claims, and
Unverified entries each occupy consecutive lines with no blank line between them. Use
`None` when Findings, Non-claims, or Unverified is empty. Every finding needs a
repository-relative file, positive line, and concrete fix. Private identifiers is a
JSON array of nonempty names/tokens appearing in projected fields; an empty array is
valid. A finding description containing a declared private identifier is refused;
remove that identifier rather than relying on display escaping. Never include
credentials. Prose punctuation is not a refusal: after path and alias sanitization,
publication refuses prose only for non-ASCII or control characters, unresolved
private identifiers, reviewer-written reserved placeholders, or residual paths and
aliases. Re-executed command strings are machine syntax and are rendered verbatim
inside the JSON fence after required path and alias sanitization. A finding
file-and-line value is not prose and retains the stricter markup and encoding
restriction.

## Analysis
Full private reasoning and additional evidence. This section is never public.

<!-- lane-review-complete -->
````

Each Re-executed object has exactly `command`, `cwd` (`lane` or `scratch`), integer
`exit_code`, nonempty `result`, boolean `tests_pass`, and `witness`. A witness is null
or has exactly `kind` (`negative-control` or `mutation`), `command`, `cwd`, integer
`exit_code`, nonempty `result`, and nonempty `observed_failure`.

## Completion

Finish only by atomically completing the designated private record. Do not send a
follow-up action, alter either checkout, or substitute chat output. If the deadline or
budget prevents a check, record that limit; do not overrun it. The foreground command
observes only this private file and may stop while the Herdr session continues.
