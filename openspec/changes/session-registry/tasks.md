# Register dispatched sessions and retire closed lanes

## Outcome

Write metadata for successful dispatch, consume both legacy registry entries and new per-session records, and mark completed close operations done. Preserve git authority and display-only semantics.

## Repository context and authorization

Read `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `docs/REFERENCE.md`, `HANDOFF.md`, and
`openspec/README.md`, then this change's `proposal.md`, `design.md`, and
`specs/session-metadata/spec.md`.
Follow the shared delivery rules in `openspec/README.md`.

Prerequisites: roots-identity promoted.
Contract approval: A2 must be approved before implementation.

This is a dispatchable future engineering brief, not authorization to implement it
in the planning session. When dispatched by the operator, work only in the current
`lane/session-registry` worktree; commit the authorized result; never push, publish,
promote, or close another lane. Do not edit the product contract unless the operator
has approved the exact amendment. One build/test at a time on the machine.

## Scope and limits

lane.mjs; built-ins-only board model/registry modules; test/; README.md; docs/REFERENCE.md; HANDOFF.md.

No global job store, scheduler, leases, validation decisions, prompt replay, raw transcript persistence, or automatic review generation.

Suggested route: `engineer`. Suggested effort: High; one focused engineering session.
Use the route's configured agent/model; do not change routing defaults.

## 1. Lane-sized task

- [ ] 1.1 Deliver this change's outcome and all applicable scenarios; verify the checks below, write `docs/reports/session-registry.md` and a dated HANDOFF entry, commit, then obtain a passing GATE against the final commit.

## Acceptance checks

Fail first on successful registration, heading/fenced-code/inline fallbacks, canonical registry path, ignore refusal before any Herdr call, two concurrent record writes, simultaneous done markers, legacy reads, cwd/start/prompt failures, post-prompt write failure, and done only after successful close. Verify no replay and no dirty checkout.

Each requirement in the adjacent delta spec is part of acceptance. Add and observe
failing regression tests before product changes; retain deliberate negative controls.
`npm test` must pass, `git diff --check` must be clean, and the complete diff must
contain no host-specific/private source text. All code tests are offline and clean
up system-temp fixtures. Preserve Node 20, git 2.38, and the dependency-free core.
Record skips precisely rather than reporting unexercised live behavior as passed.

## Handoff and promotion boundary

The report must list files/behavior, negative controls, test counts, measurements,
remaining limits, and any needed approval. Use a public-safe reviewed-SHA record in
`docs/reviews/session-registry/` if an independent review is requested; review is never
an automated promotion gate.

Sync only this implemented delta into its current spec before the final commit.
After the final report/HANDOFF commit, run `lane check` and paste the exact GATE
line in the conversation. Keep that final line out of a new tracked commit.
The operator promotes independently using the unchanged validated fast-forward
workflow; archive only after promotion as described in `openspec/README.md`.
