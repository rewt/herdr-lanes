## Purpose

Keep each lane attached to its owning repository and development root, independent
of duplicate basenames, workspace labels, and the caller's linked checkout.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Canonical repository identity
Lane operations SHALL use canonical git common-directory identity and verify a
worktree belongs to that identity before using it as a lane.
#### Scenario: Same repository name in two roots
- **WHEN** both roots open the same topic using their root-local defaults
- **THEN** each gets its own `.worktrees/<repo>/lane-<topic>` and lane branch without sharing git state.
#### Scenario: Shared base collision
- **WHEN** two different repositories deliberately resolve to the same occupied lane destination
- **THEN** the second operation refuses and neither repository's existing work changes.

### Requirement: Safe sibling creation
New lane creation SHALL refuse unsafe realpath destinations and SHALL never choose
an automatic temporary-directory fallback.
#### Scenario: Symlink or descendant escape
- **WHEN** a destination resolves into a repository checkout or outside the selected worktree base through a symlink
- **THEN** open names the unsafe path and exits before branch creation or a Herdr mutation.
#### Scenario: Legacy registered lane
- **WHEN** an existing lane's verified git worktree is outside the new default base
- **THEN** lifecycle operations still find it without moving or adopting another checkout.

### Requirement: Canonical parent and unambiguous labels
New lane Herdr workspaces SHALL be children of their canonical repository workspace
and use the design's root/repository/topic labels. Controls SHALL resolve by IDs and
verified paths. Agent names SHALL meet Herdr length and uniqueness rules.
#### Scenario: Open invoked from another lane
- **WHEN** a lane command is invoked inside a linked checkout
- **THEN** the new child is opened under the canonical repository workspace, not beneath the caller's lane.
#### Scenario: Matching display text or stale metadata
- **WHEN** a workspace label matches but its checkout identity does not
- **THEN** the CLI refuses to use it for dispatch or close.
#### Scenario: Root identity remains git-owned
- **WHEN** lanes open and dispatch in repositories with different git identities
- **THEN** existing git config and environment determine author identity, and lane writes no identity setting.
